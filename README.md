# neural-network-challenge-1

In this project we use a student loan data set and a neural network to predict students' credit rankings.\
The dataset can be found here: [https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m18/lms/datasets/student-loans.csv]\
The notebook file and the final model, the keras file, can be found in the M18 Starter Files folder.

### Preprocessing:
First we split our data into X and y, where y is the credit ranking. Then perform our train test split on\
the data and use the standard scaler on our X train and test data.

### Creating the Model
